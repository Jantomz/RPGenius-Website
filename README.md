RPGenius enables its users to study in a more rewarding and effective way. It combines aspects from role-playing games and the progression levels that they provide along with an emphasis on studying. Through the RPGenius in-game progression model students are heavily encouraged to study more to get more rewards. The way this works is that with RPGenius user’s gain experience levels and coins over time. At a certain threshold once the user has reached a certain experience level they level up while user’s gain coins every ten seconds. With coins user’s can purchase different backgrounds for their in-game character and study music. Furthermore, with certain levels being achieved user’s gain access to different skins. Both of these accessories/vanity items encourage students to study more. Furthermore, there is a quiz feature at the bottom of the page which allows users to make their own test question study sets. Once a user has performed a test that they have created they get additional coins.

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.
